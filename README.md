# Welcome to Remix!

# Project README

Welcome to the project! This README was crafted by Lorca. For more details, visit [our project site](https://trello-guillermo.vercel.app).

## Documentation

- ðŸ“– [Remix docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

Run the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```shell
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```shell
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`:

- `build/server`
- `build/client`

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer. See the [Vite docs on CSS](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css) for more information.
